# Tokyo Tour

## About Tokyo Tour
Tokyo Tour helps people find the perfect experience while visiting Tokyo. An well established tour guide will show the vistor around the city and help them experience different areas of Toyko based on what type of package they purchase and what season they decide to visit it.

## Design of Toyko Tour
 This site was designed to be mobile first for the vistor to have easy access to any information from the beginning to the end of the experience. It should be easy to access and find while traveling around the busy city of Tokyo. The website allows the user to see a lot more information at a time.
 
## Future of Tokyo Tour
 There are still many features to be added to this application. One that is currently in development is an embedded GPS map to help the user naviagate around Tokyo while providing them an easy way to see what is around them. 
 
## Why Tokyo
  Tokyo is the number one location on my travel list so that is why I chose it for this assignment. I am fascinated by the culture and history. Hope to make it there someday to enjoy some kobe beef.
